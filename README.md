# Spam-Filter-and-Salary-Predictor
There are two models in this repository. One model labels an email message as spam or not spam using a Naive Bayesian Classifier (NBC). The salary predictor uses Logistic Regression to predict whether or not a person's salary is greater than a particular threshold.
